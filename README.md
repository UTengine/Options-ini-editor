Knight Online option.exe rebuild by myself
If you don't want to use the SMFL Lib's, and want to build the project in a minimal state ASAP, you can just add items to the combilist by right clicking it properties and it should show the properties toolbox from there on you can edit its items collections.
Or you can just simply do:
comboBox1->Items->Add("1280x1024");
comboBox1->Items->Add("1280x720");
comboBox1->Items->Add("1024x768");
